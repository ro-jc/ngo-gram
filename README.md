# Vol-N-GO
Connect volunteers and NGOs.


A website that intends to connect NGOs and potential volunteers, presenting a social media like feed of events that users can attend and pages of NGOs that users can browse. This will make it easier for NGOs to get volunteers even on a per event basis and increase engagement of people with NGOs, providing them the push they need.
## Key Features of the website:
+ Users can register
+ NGOs can register
+ NGOs can post about events that they are holding and have users register and attend events without having to be a part of the NGO itself
+ Users can explore NGOs that interest them and will have a direct line to contact them
+ Userâ€™s preferences and data is collected in a database; NGOs can get recommendations of volunteers on basis of their interest and the extent of participation (establishing credibility)
+ Easier for users to participate in NGOs that interest them and easier for NGOs to recruit legitimate volunteers
+ Screening of volunteers can be done and established in the database (variety of implementations possible)
+ A network of NGOs and volunteers is created
+ Easy for creation of outreach by the NGO across different regions of operations
